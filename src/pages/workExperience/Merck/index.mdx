Having finished my Master's program in London, I looked for a position in drug discovery. I've was quite fortunate and landed a spot at Merck, in the Chemical Biology team. Here, I've been working on multiple projects involved in target identification, as well as transcriptomics. I'm not sure how much I can say, but I've linked a poster that the team presented below!
