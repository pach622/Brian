The work I did at the Swardfager lab (link) was a dry lab project, where we aimed to identify biomarkers for cognitive impairment in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.

## My Work.

This meta-analysis needed me to review thousands of articles and extract information from each legible paper. Afterwards, we used R-Studio to analyze the data. Here, I was able to improve my dry-lab analysis skills, as well as improve my ability to communicate effectively.

If you want to understand the findings of the study, its actually published!

## Learning Outcomes.

This project was completely remote, so I felt that communication was especially important. I regulated updated my supervisor, as well as presented results to the group.
